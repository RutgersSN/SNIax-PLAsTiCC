# SNIax-PLAsTiCC
The type-Iax supernova model by Saurabh W. Jha and Mi Dai used in [PLAsTiCC](https://plasticc.org).

The SED template is based on observations of SN 2005hk and it is adapted to match the luminosity function and light curve parameters for a population of SN Iax. The details are in the notebook [Iax-model.ipynb](Iax-model.ipynb).
